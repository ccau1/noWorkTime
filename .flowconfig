# This is where your own flow-typed libdefs go


# These declarations are super explicit...
# We want to show what libdef files we need to make
# flow understand all external dependencies
#
# If you have similar dependencies, you will need to
# check which libdef files are covered by your flow-typed
# directory!
#
# A more generic approach (please use with caution!):
# node_modules/styled-components/flow-typed/*.js
